Binary Trees
This repository focuses on the concept of binary trees, which are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected through edges. Each node can have at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Structure
The basic structure of a binary tree node typically includes the following components:

c
"""
struct binary_tree_s {
    int n;  /* Integer stored in the node */
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;  /* Pointer to the parent node */
    struct binary_tree_s *left;  /* Pointer to the left child node */
    struct binary_tree_s *right;  /* Pointer to the right child node */
};
"""

Here, n represents the integer value stored in the node, parent points to the parent node, and left and right are pointers to the left and right child nodes, respectively.

Binary Search Tree (BST)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized type of binary tree that follows a specific ordering rule. In a BST, for any given node, the value of every node in its left subtree is less than its value, and the value of every node in its right subtree is greater than its value. This ordering property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Time Complexity
Binary trees provide improved time complexity compared to linked lists for certain operations. In a balanced binary tree, the time complexity of searching, insertion, and deletion operations is typically O(log n), where n represents the number of nodes in the tree. This logarithmic time complexity is more efficient than the linear time complexity of linked lists.

Terminology
To better understand binary trees, it is important to be familiar with the following terminology:

Depth: The depth of a node represents the number of edges from the root to that node.
Height: The height of a node represents the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node. The height of a tree is the height of its root node.
Size: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes it contains.
Traversal: Traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree in a specific order. Common traversal methods include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
Complete Binary Tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Full Binary Tree: A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Perfect Binary Tree: A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most one.
